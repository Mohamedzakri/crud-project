		403 forbidden:
			doesn't return the saved user.

		reset user table ids to 0
		delete seq tables
	.{solution}

	.{issues-done}
		still fails to authenticate:
			it succedes at making a request to a simple get endpoint that prints a string after registering and authenticating,
			but fails to make a call to the rest endpoints 
				how?: 
					added @jsonignore on @ManyToOne

		403 forbidden:
			saves new user but returns 403.
			fixed token table because it had an additional user id column
			how?: 
				"removed" the to string from taskEntities and token in the user userEntity (@ToString.Exclude)

		app doesn't save a new user with the register endpoint:
			saves only the password and email bur nothing else.
